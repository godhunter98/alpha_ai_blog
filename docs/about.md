# This website was created by [Harsh Malik](https://x.com/harshshelby) as a part of his deep learning journey.

What began as a fascination with simple linear regression models quickly evolved into a quest to understand the intricacies of artificial intelligence. 
My early experiments were modest—a handful of features and basic algorithms—but they laid the foundation for a much larger exploration. 

Over time, I delved into neural networks, experimented with deep learning architectures, and eventually ventured into the realm of fine-tuning large language models for diverse and creative applications.

Along the way, I've embraced both the excitement of breakthrough moments and the challenges of complex problems. Each project, no matter how small, has offered lessons in persistence, innovation, and the transformative power of technology. This blog serves as a chronicle of that journey—a space where I document experiments, share insights, and reflect on the evolving landscape of machine learning and AI.

**Here, you'll find discussions on everything from the basics of model training to the nuances of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques**. My hope is that by sharing my experiences, I can inspire others to explore the vast potential of artificial intelligence, whether you're just beginning or already well on your way in your own journey.

### **Welcome to my evolving adventure into the world of deep learning. Let's explore the future of AI together.**
